# StudentLibrary

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.18.

## Installing Our Application

If you are reading this, you have sucessfully cloned our Git Repository.

- Before you run the application, you will have to install the following:

    - [Node TypeScript](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & Angular:

        - Step 1: Install Node using the link above. Ensure you install the correct one for your operating system. When asked where to install Node, please ensure you select the StudentLibraryS folder.

        - Step 2: In your terminal, move to the root directory of the project using the `cd` command. (StudentLibraryS)

        - Step 3: Enter `npm install -g @angular/cli`. This will download Angular to the directory.

        - Step 4: Enter `npm install`. This will download all of the Node Modules.
        
        
    - Notes :
        - Please ensure you enter the commands in that exact order or you may incur problems.
        - If using an IOS operating system you may have to add "sudo" to all of your commands.

## Running Our Application 

- Once Node and Angular have been installed, you should be good to go!

- Ensure you are still in the root directory of the project in your terminal (StudentLibraryS).

- To run the application, enter:

    - `ng serve -o`. This will open the application in your browser.
    - Sometimes this command may cause issues with compiling so if this doesn't work just use `ng serve`.
    - Preferably use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## What To Search For In The Library

- When you run the application you will see a search container for searching for books in the system.

    - Beacause this is a prototype, we have only entered a number of our books into the system. They are as follows:

        - "100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People"

        - "About Face"

        - "Designing Interfaces"

        - "Don't Make Me Think"

        - "UI is Communication"
        
        - "User Interface Design for Programmers"

        - Plus a few more.

## Accessibile Functionality To Look Out For:

- On our Home Page, we have included a button that will allow users with any form of color blindness to increase the font and change some of the colours to a nice dark theme so the text can be read easily.

- On our Citing, Referencing and Plagarisim page, we have a similar piece of functionality that increases the font size and displays the text in a more suitable color theme for easy reading.

- On our availability of the library page, we included a zoom function when viewing the current capacity of each floor. You simply hover over the text and both the font size and background color will change which makes it much easier to see.

- Throughout the entire application, we ensured to use suitable tags that will allow any users with a disability navigate through our app using screen readers. These tags include tabindex's, aria-label's, alt's and much more.
